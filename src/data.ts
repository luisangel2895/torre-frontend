    summaryOfBio:
      "Im the CEO of Torre (http://torre.co), the matching network for work. We make the process of finding work and finding talent humane, transparent, and automated. Torre&#x27;s long-term goal is to enable everyone to find fulfilling work opportunities. It&#x27;s a moonshot: we&#x27;re becoming -to LinkedIn and Indeed- what WhatsApp is to iMessage, and Google is to Yahoo. Previously, I co-founded and bootstrapped Voice123 (http://voice123.com) in 2002 (the first and largest global marketplace for voice-overs with over 200,000 voice actors and 100,000 buyers), as well as Bunny Studio ( http://bunnystudio.com ) in 2011 (a mission-critical outsourcing solution for creative work), with my wife Tania Zapata. We sold Voice123 to Backstage and TA Associates. With hundreds of thousands of users, availability in five languages, and team members in 10+ countries, both companies are growing steadily. In 2018 I co-founded Tribe (http://withyourtribe.com), a remote-first video communication platform. I hold multiple patents related to the dynamics of two-sides marketplaces, I was honored by MIT with the Innovator Under 35 award in 2012, with the High-Impact Entrepreneur title by Endeavor in 2013, and named Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum in 2015. Together, Tania and I have angel-invested in 20+ tech companies. I joined Sony&#x27;s Shark Tank Colombia as an investor in 2017. In 2018, I co-founded Torrenegra Accelerator (http://torrenegra.com/) a remote, life-long accelerator for bootstrapped entrepreneurs. I&#x27;ve written several practical guides and frameworks: https://medium.com/tag/torrenegra-frameworks/top/all-time Test",
